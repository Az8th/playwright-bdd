# Writing steps
There are several ways of writing step definitions:
1. [Playwright-style](writing-steps/playwright-style.md) - recommended for new projects or adding BDD to existing Playwright projects
2. [Cucumber-style](writing-steps/cucumber-style.md) - recommended for migrating existing CucumberJS projects to Playwright runner
3. [Cucumber-style (legacy)](writing-steps/cucumber-style-legacy.md) - not recommended to use, kept here just for reference
