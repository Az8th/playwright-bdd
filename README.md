Run [BDD](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) runner.

> Inspired by the issue in the Playwright repo [microsoft/playwright#11975](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11975)

## Why Playwright runner?
Both [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) have their own test runners. 
You can use CucumberJS runner with [Playwright as a library](https://medium.com/@manabie/how-to-use-playwright-in-cucumberjs-f8ee5b89bccc) to test BDD scenarios.
This package offers **an alternative way**: convert BDD scenarios into Playwright tests and run them with Playwright runner as usual. 
Such approach brings all the benefits of Playwright runner:

* Automatic browser initialization and cleanup
* Power of [Playwright fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#with-fixtures)
* Out-of-box [screenshot testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots)
* Parallelization with [sharding](https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/using-playwright-test-shards-in-combination-with-a-job-matrix-to-improve-your-ci-speed#after)
* [...a lot more](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#key-differences)
